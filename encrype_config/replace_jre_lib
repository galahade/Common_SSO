My answer is a bit late but I wrote it to help anyone in need. By default, spring security uses a 256-bit key for encryption. This is not permitted by the JDK by default, which supported up to 128-bit keys only.

To solve this, you need need to download the local_policy.jar & US_export_policy.jar jars from oracle (Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 7 Download) and replace them in jdk_path/jre/lib/security/. Make sure you restart the application server for the changes to take effect.

On a separate note, I wouldn't place the secret key in a properties file. Instead I recommend you put it in a key store. If you need help with that let me know.
